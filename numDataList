# Description: Program asks the user to enter X numbers into a list. Then it calculates and shows the sum, average, min, and max of those numbers.

X = int(input("How many numbers would you like to enter? "))
aList = []
for X in range (0, X, 1):
    num = int(input("Please enter a number %i : " %(X + 1)))
    aList.append(num)
print('numbers = ', aList)

smallest = aList[0] #make smallest equal to the first value of the list
for i in range(1, len(aList), 1):
    #compare smallest to every other number on the list
    if aList[i] < smallest: #if any number is smaller...
        smallest = aList[i] #smallest is equal to that number
print('The smallest number is', smallest)

largest = aList[0] #make largest equal to the first value of the list
for i in range(1, len(aList), 1):
    #compare largest to every other number on the list
    if aList[i] > largest: #if any number is larger...
        largest = aList[i] #largest is equal to that number
print('The largest number is', largest)

#find the sum of all numbers in the list
sum = 0
#loop that goes through all the numbers
for index in range(0, len(aList), 1):
    sum = sum + aList[index]
print("The sum is", sum)

#find the average of all numbers in the list
avg = sum / len(aList)
print("The average is", avg)
