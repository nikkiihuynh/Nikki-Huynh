# Description: Program to convert any given number of total cents (under 100( into the corerct number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies.

totalCents = int(input('enter total cents:'))

# use integer division to get a whole number for quarters:
quarters = int(totalCents/25)

# if there are any quarters...
if quarters > 0: # more than zero quarters
    # show how many quarters they have
    print ('you have', quarters, 'quarters')
    # now subtract the quarters from total cents
    totalCents = totalCents - quarters*25 #totalCents=66-2*25=15
    # ^ new value for the remaining total cents

dimes = int(totalCents/10) # int(15/10) is 1
# if there are any dimes...
if dimes > 0: # more than zero dimes
    # show how many dimes they have
    print ('you have', dimes, 'dimes')
    # now subtract the dimes from total cents
    totalCents = totalCents - dimes*10 # totalCents=15-1*10=5
    # ^ new value for the remaining total cents

# now do the same for nickels and pennies
nickels = int(totalCents/5)
# if there are any nickels...
if nickels > 0: # more than zero nickels
    # show how many nickels they have
    print ('you have', nickels, 'nickels')
    # now subtract the nickels from total cents
    totalCents = totalCents - nickels*5

pennies = int(totalCents/1)
# if there are any pennies...
if pennies > 0: #more than zero pennies
    # show how many pennies they have
    print('you have', pennies, 'pennies')
    # now substract the pennies from total cents
    totalCents = totalCents - pennies*1
